# I16 - Verify partial ag rhmi config

## Description

Solution Explorer no longer allows dedicated-admins to change the cluster configuration. The RHMI Getting Started and Admin Guide should no longer include any of this functionality.

- Merge Request: TBD
- Jira ref link: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHMIDOC-241
- Peer contact: Ben Hardesty

* Staging doc link: TBD

## Steps

1. Navigate to the Getting Started guide.

> In the "Administrator and Developer roles" section, the definition of the administrator is technically correct and no longer mentions any functionality that has been removed from RHMI.

2. Navigate to the Admin guide.

> The "Customizing the Managed Integration cluster" chapter is removed.
